# fairSIM
Free Analysis and Interactive Reconstruction for Structured Illumination Microscopy

A publication accompanying the plugin has been published in [Nature Communications](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2016/160321/ncomms10980/abs/ncomms10980.html) (open access):

```
Marcel Müller, Viola Mönkemöller, Simon Hennig, Wolfgang Hübner, Thomas Huser (2016).
"Open-source image reconstruction of super-resolution structured illumination microscopy data in ImageJ",
Nature Communications, doi: 10.1038/ncomms10980
```

This is the **development branch** for the integration of full 3D SR-SIM reconstruction
support into fairSIM. For release versions, please switch to the master branch.

Commits in this branch will likely be unstable, contain known 
errors and will often not compile. 

The **Vector API** is likely to change in the next weeks and month!
Also, the 3D code is currently not finished and not working.
