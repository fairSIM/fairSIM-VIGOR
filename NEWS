 Summary of important user-visible changes for fairSIM 1.2.0 (2017/07/31):
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** fairSIM can now be built with the maven build system.

 ** fairSIM will now connect to standard JTransforms (3.1),
    additionally to shipping its own fork.  The maven build will only
    build against JTransforms, the makefile can use both.

    filtering.  See https://www.nature.com/articles/srep37149 for more
    detail.  To enable the feature, use the "settings" menu for the
    reconstruction.

 ** Time-lapse mode can now be switched to rerun the parameter
    estimation on every time point.

 ** This version supports reconstruction time-lapse (multiple time
    points) SIM stacks.

    will not be ideal)
